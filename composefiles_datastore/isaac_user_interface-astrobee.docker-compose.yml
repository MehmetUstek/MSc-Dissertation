    # When the user wants to use the ISAAC UI with
    # the Astrobee simulation, the ISAAC UI will
    # build a slightly different ROS Bridge node Docker
    # container that is based on the Dockerfile.astrobee file
    # within /rosbridge
    #
    # The purpose of this change is to let the ISAAC UI
    # user specify custom ROS messages.
